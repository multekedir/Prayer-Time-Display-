This program use's the python Athan Time calculation from http://praytimes.org/.
It displays the prayer times for Eugene Islamic Center. The Iqama time is entered 
on a java program and then saved on iqama.txt. Run the program by executing the 
script Run.sh. The script will then run the main class, 'display.py'. To change 
the Iqama time run src/Python/display.py and then hit space-bar. For the correct 
iqama display enter time in HH:MM PM/AM format or '+number' to add to the Athan 
time.
